### Life after Epicodus

### Goals
I don't want to lose the momentum I built while attending Epicodus. Moving forward it is very important to me that I keep to daily schedule that includes both writing code and working on creative projects. I want to build an online presence for myself that showcases both my creative work and my technical skills. I plan to approach my continued self-study with this in mind, and to focus on becoming more comfortable with JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks.

> **Current Priorities:**
- Job Hunt
- Coding self-study
- UX/UI self-study
- Design portfolio

#### How I plan to organize a typical work-day:

One of the most important things I learned at Epicodus was how to work through challenges, sitting with a problem for a while and working through it. With this in mind, I want to structure my days to include designated time to focus on my goals. The amount of time I devote each day to a specific task will vary depending on deadlines, interview opportunities and other priorities that arise. Some days I might want to spend the whole day on a coding challenge for example. The schedule below is a guide that I plan to stick to most of the time, particularly on days when I am not working on a longer project.

**6am**

> **Focus on wellness** - exercise, meditation, etc.

**8am - 10am**

> **Code** - spend _at least_ the first two hours of the day on coding challenges, tutorials, readings, and projects. I know mornings are the best time for me to learn technical concepts so I want to start each day here.

**10am - 12n**

> **Job applications** - apply to jobs and follow up on previous applications, reach out to contacts on LinkedIn, request informational interviews, research companies, and perform any other job-search related activities.

**1pm - 3pm**

> **Design Portfolio** - work on my design portfolio, for both web development and graphic design.

**3pm - 5pm**

> **Technical aspects of design** - work through tutorials and practice with In Design, Illustrator, Adobe XD, and related tools. Study UX/UI concepts, work on my online presence.
