### Goals
I don't want to lose the momentum I built while attending Epicodus. Above all the program has taught me how to organize my time as I work through coding challenges, and when and where to seek resources for solving problems. Moving forward, I would

_Current Priorities:_
- Job Hunt
- Coding self-study
- UX/UI self-study
- Design portfolio

***************************
#### How I plan to organize a typical work-day:

Of course the amount of time I devote each day to a specific task will vary depending on deadlines, interview opportunities and other things that arise, I want to stick to this basic schedule most of the time.

**6am**

> **Focus on wellness** - exercise, meditation, etc.

**8am - 10am**

> **Code** - spend _at least_ the first two hours of the day on coding challenges, tutorials, readings, and projects.

**10am - 12n**

> **Job applications** - apply to jobs and follow up on previous applications, reach out to contacts on LinkedIn, set up informational interviews, research companies, and any other job-search related activities.

**1pm - 3pm**

> **Design Portfolio** - work on my design portfolio, both digital and otherwise.

**3pm - 5pm**

> **Technical aspects of design** - work through tutorials and practice with In Design, Illustrator, Adobe XD, and related tools. Study UX/UI concepts, work on my online presence.
